    echo "4. Generate reports"
    echo "5. Exit"

    read -p "Enter your choice (1-5): " choice

    case $choice in
        1) # Add a new record
           # Implement the logic for adding a new record
           ;;
        2) # Edit existing records
           # Implement the logic for editing records
           ;;
        3) # Search for specific records
           # Implement the logic for searching records
           ;;
        4) # Generate reports
           # Implement the logic for generating reports
           ;;
        5) # Exit
           echo "Exiting the Personal Record Management System. Goodbye!"
           exit 0
           ;;
        *) # Handle invalid input
           echo "Invalid choice. Please enter a number between 1 and 5."
           ;;
    esac

    read -p "Press Enter to continue..."
done
